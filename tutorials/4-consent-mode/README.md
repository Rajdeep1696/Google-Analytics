# GA Tutorial Series - Consent Mode

This folder contains the code used in the
[Consent Mode tutorial video](https://youtu.be/MqAEbshMv84) on YouTube

## Run the current version of the website

You must install [Deno](https://deno.land) to run the website code.

Once you install Deno, run the local web server with the following command:

```
deno task start
```

Then, open <http://localhost> in your web browser.

By default, the server listens on port 80. If that port is in use or is
otherwise unavailable, override the port using the `--port` argument.  For
example, you could run the server on port 8000 as follows:

```
deno task start --port 8000
```

Then, open <http://localhost:8000> in your web browser.
